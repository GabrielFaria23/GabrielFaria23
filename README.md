## **:man_technologist: About me**
I am 22 years old, I am an outgoing person, I like to make new friends, learn about new technologies, improve my knowledge in technologies I already know, exchange ideas with more experienced people, I believe this is essential no matter what you want to learn and besides, I have been studying English for about 10 months and graduated in Computer Science at the University Center of Minas Gerais - UNIFOR-MG, in late 2019. 

Currently studying about Spring Boot and Angular, which are two frameworks that I like very much because they are practical and make the development of the project very easy, especially in the configuration part. I have been betting on these technologies, because besides being technologies that I love to work with, they also have great demand in the job market. I hope to get a job opportunity soon and be able to professionalize and learn even more about these frameworks.
